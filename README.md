# Cyber-Bully-Tweet-Classifier Intro
A Cyber Bully Tweet Classifier is a machine learning model designed to identify and categorize tweets as either bullying or non-bullying.
It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of tweets.
The classifier is trained on labeled datasets containing examples of both bullying and non-bullying tweets.
By learning patterns and features from this data, it can predict the likelihood that a new tweet contains cyberbullying. 
This tool helps in monitoring and mitigating online harassment.
Cyberbullying on Twitter involves using tweets to harass, threaten, or demean individuals, often under the veil of anonymity. 
This form of digital harassment can quickly reach a wide audience due to the platform's public and rapid nature. 
Common tactics include insults, spreading rumors, defamatory content, and inciting others to participate in the harassment. 
The consequences for victims are severe, often leading to emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts.
